I am a tenured [Assistant Professor of Norwegian](https://www.oslomet.no/en/about/employee/eiten9710/) at the Department of Early Childhood Education (BLU) at OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University. I am also a [Guest Researcher of Linguistics](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/people/aca/scandinavian-languages/temporary/eirikten/) at the Department of Linguistics and Scandinavian Studies (ILN) at the University of Oslo (UiO).

Further, I am a PhD Student at UiO specialising in Scandinavian linguistics. My PhD project involves exploring prosodic variation in Norwegian verb–particle constructions. The project is connected to the RCN funded project [Variation and Change in the Scandinavian Verb Phrase](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/projects/variation-and-change-in-the-scandinavian-verb-phra/).
