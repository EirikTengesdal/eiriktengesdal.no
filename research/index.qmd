### Prosodic Variation in Norwegian Verb–Particle Constructions

My PhD project investigates prosodic variation in Norwegian verb–particle constructions. This research is part of the RCN funded project [Variation and Change in the Scandinavian Verb Phrase](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/projects/variation-and-change-in-the-scandinavian-verb-phra/).

**Key research questions:**
- How does prosodic variation manifest in Norwegian verb-particle constructions?
- What factors influence this variation?
- How does this compare across Scandinavian languages?
